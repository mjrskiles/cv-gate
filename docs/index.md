## A Sound Byte Labs Eurorack Module

cv-gate (name WIP) is a compact 1U analog utility module for Eurorack synthesizers. It provides a versatile gate processor with both manual and CV control. It also functions as a waveshaper, turning any input wave into a square wave.

## Features

- Bipolar CV input with adjustable threshold
- Manual gate button
- Visual feedback via LED
- Compact 1U, 6HP Eurorack format

## How It Works

Buttongate processes input CV signals through an analog window comparator with peak detection. The module allows you to:

- Set thresholds for both positive and negative voltages using a single control
- Manually trigger output with the button (overrides CV input)
- Get clean, buffered output signals at audio rates
- See processing state through indicator LEDs
